# Prims_Algorithm_Demo
The project at hand provides a graphical representation of Prims Algorithm using OpenGL

The project takes the number of nodes as input followed by a matrix representing the 
graph. You can choose to the position the nodes anywhere within the window and see 
the graphical representation of the graph and generate a minimum spanning tree for 
the given input graph.

For linux users:
Go to the directory where prims_algo_linux.cpp is saved.

$ gcc prims_algo_linux.cpp -lGLU -lGL -lglut -lm -Wno-write-strings
$ ./a.out 

For windows users:
Install codeblocks
